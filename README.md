# fenreese's QMK Config for Keeb.io Iris Rev 7

Hi. This is my (work in progress) config for the [Keeb.io Iris](https://keeb.io/products/iris-keyboard-split-ergonomic-keyboard). Pictures to be added later as I finalize my non-letter layers.

## Goals
- Compatibility with all the operating systems I use regularly (Good luck with that)
- A usable "Vim mode" (Good luck with this x2)
- Intuitive keybindings (Will probably experiment more with these)

## Issues
- The `_VIM` layer doesn't work cleanly on Mac as it (theoretically) should on Windows/Linux.
    - The `CG_TOGG` button messes up all the other keybindings I have with Super and Ctrl, including the Vim layers.
    - Man, fuck MacOS for being such a special OS that the copy/paste shortcuts are locked under the *Super* button and not the *Ctrl* button.
- The `_SYMBOL` layer, especially on the left hand, isn't as intuitive as I thought it would be.
- I need more RGB customization.
